# Sorting Visualization

**NOTE**: The project currently only visualizes 3 algorithms. I will add more features, improve the visualizations and add more sorting algorithms in the free time I get this semester (Summer 2021).

(IN PROGRESS) This is a sorting visualizer.\
 It shows how different sorting algorithms sort arrays of numbers using JavaScript.\
